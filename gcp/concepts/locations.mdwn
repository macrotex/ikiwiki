# Location Groupings

*Zone*: the finest-grain. Can think of as a data center. Examples:
`us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `asia-northeast1`

*Region*: zones grouped into regions. A region is an "independent
geographic area". Zones in the same region have very fast network
interconnects. Examples: `us-central1`, `us-west2`, `asia-south1`,

*Multi-region*: a geographic area containing more than one
region. Example: us, europe, australia.

*Global*: everything. Example: virtual priviate clouds (VPCs) are global.

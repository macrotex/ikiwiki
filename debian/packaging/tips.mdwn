# Debian Packaging Tips

* For non-native packages, if you are attempting to upload a Debian
package to a repository and the `.orig` tarball is not already uploaded,
you will need to build the package so that it includes this tarball. To
build and include the `.orig` tar-ball, use the
`-sa` option. This option is passed to `dpkg-source`:

        $ dkgp-buildpackage -us -uc -sa
               or
        $ gbp buildpackage -sa

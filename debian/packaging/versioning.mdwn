# Debian package versioning

## Introduction

Start here: [section 5.6.12 of the Debian Policy
Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-version)
or the man page for `deb-version`.

Short answer: the package version is

    upstream_version[-debian_revision]

A package without a debian revision number indicates the package was
written to be a Debian package.

## Examples

slapd (2.4.44+dfsg-5+deb9u2): The upstream version is `2.4.44+dfsg` and
the debian revision is `5+deb9u2`.

linux-base (4.5~deb8u1): The upstream version is `4.5~deb8u1` and there is
NO debian revision number.

The first number in the debian revision indicates how often the debian
package has been revised, starting over at `1` when the upstream version
changes. The `+deb9u2` indicates that the Debian packaging itself has not
changed, but that a patch has been added to the Debian package build so
address some security or other software issue.


## Notes

For an exaplanation of `+dfsg` see [What does "dfsg" or "ds" in the
version string
mean?"](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq#What_does_.2BIBw-dfsg.2BIB0_or_.2BIBw-ds.2BIB0_in_the_version_string_mean.3F).

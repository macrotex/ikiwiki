# Lambda For Containers

## Introduction

The AWS Lambda service allows the running of small bits of codes in a
"serverless" environment. This means I don't have to worry about the
back-end resources, they just run.

AWS Lambda supports several programming languages including Python, Java,
Go, Nodejs, and others. What it *doesn't* support is running a full
container.

An alternative to this would be to run the container in
Kubernetes. However, this is more overhead than I want. Furthermore,
Kubernetes implies that there are EC2 instances running all the time. What
I want is a service that only uses AWS resources when needed.

The option I settled on is to use ECS Fargate which allows me to run
containers on demand and not worry about the underlying server
infrastructure. In this document I will describe how to set up a complete
workflow using ECS Fargate as well other parts of the AWS environment to
deploy an ikiwiki web page.
